# Amazon Web Scraping using Python

In this project I did data scraping from Amazon using Python.
Additionally, I set up an automatic timer to pull data and keep the data in excel files, as well as automatically emailing when certain criteria was met.

I hope you enjoy! Please feel free to leave me feedback.
